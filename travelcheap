The travel and tourism industry contributed a total of 113.2 billion U.S. dollars to GDP in India in 2013 – this accounted for 5.35 percent of India’s total GDP. On the country average, an Indian travels about 50 kms per day which about accounts to about 19000 kms per year. About 5 out of 10 times, an Indian overpays for the transportation due to lack of travel route knowledge. What if he already knew about the cheapest route with the minimum traffic beforehand?

TravelCheap is a mobile application that shows the cheapest route between the source and the destination. The source and the destination are taken as an input from the user. With the help of different API's, the routes are drawn on the google map with the help of polylines. After fetching all of the routes, they are shown to the user in the increasing order of costs. The list of the routes also shows the distance of the route and the modes of transportation involved . Upon clicking of an individual route, the subroutes are shown to the user with their specific mode of transportation.

Currently, the app has been made from the point of view of the state of Delhi. Local transportations of other states of India will be updated. Even intercity transportation modes such as airplanes, railways and intercity buses will be integrated. This way, the user will have the cheapest route from any two points in the entire country.
Another feature that the team will be implementing is that it would setup another dedicated server for storing real time movement of the user and their location which would be used for pooling of individuals using our app. In that way, people would be able to save more money if they find someone going on their subroute on a similar timestamp.

India is a cost-saving country. Therefore for a particular product to make an impact in India, it should be pocketfriendly which our app fulfills perfectly. With the cost factor in mind, our app could become the single largest aggregator of all the transportations and therefore the users would no longer need to visit different apps to cater to different transportation modes for price differences. They would no longer be overcharged for their transportation and would get to their destination with minimum hustle.

 My experience with the campus shark competition has been a rollercoaster. So we applied just on the deadline of the competition with a simple idea. And next what we hear is we made it to the top 25 most promising ideas. Now me and my team mate are android developers so we knew we could build the prototype but we didn't have experience in backend development. Thats when the mentors of the programme really helped see the product go through. We pitched our product through a video conference. I personally was not satified with my pitch. But fortunately, we won the 3rd price. We seriously hope our product makes it to the finish line and impacts the community around us in a positive way.

 I think Digital Ocean did a commendable job in organizing this competition so flawlessly. My only suggestion will be to try to arrange an offline pitch next time so that the interaction between the contestant and the jury is a little more clear and direct. I wish the team all the best and hope to participate in many more such competitions.
